## About
A simple tool that allows you to record short animated GIF images from your screen.

Currently only Linux with X11 is supported. Other Unix like systems using X11
should work as well. It is planned to also support Wayland and maybe other
operating systems in the future.

## Requirements
### Runtime

  * GTK+ >= 3.14
  * GLib >= 2.38
  * FFmpeg
  * ImageMagick
  * Window manager with compositing enabled

### Development

 * Vala compiler
 * CMake >= 2.8.8
 * Gettext (>= 0.19 for localized .desktop entry)

## Installation
### Arch Linux
For Arch Linux there is a
[PKGBUILD](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/peek/) available in the AUR.

### Ubuntu / Debian
You can install the latest versions of Peek from the
[Ubuntu PPA](https://code.launchpad.net/~peek-developers/+archive/ubuntu/stable).

  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:peek-developers/stable
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install peek

If you want to use the latest development version there is also a
[PPA with daily builds](https://code.launchpad.net/~peek-developers/+archive/ubuntu/daily)
available.

The deb packages from this PPA probably will also work on Debian.

### From source

    cmake . && make
    make install
