# Peek build and packaging notes
This file contains information about building and packaging Peek. The
information here is mainly for developers and packagers, end users should
refer to the installation instructions in README.md.

## Building

### Building from source

From inside the Peek source folder run:

    mkdir -p build
    cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..
    make

Or you can build with [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/):

    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -GNinja ..
    ninja

`ninja` might be called `ninja-build` on some distributions.

### Build and run tests

    cmake -DBUILD_TESTS=ON ..
    make
    make test

### Running Peek with debug output

    G_MESSAGES_DEBUG=all ./peek

    make update-po
    make peek.pot-update

    cmake \
      -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr \
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
      -DGSETTINGS_COMPILE=OFF ..
    make package

### Flatpak

Install the GNOME runtime and SDK as described in
http://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/getting-setup.html

**Note:** Flatpak >= 0.9.3 is required for the build.

Build Flatpak and place it in flatpak-repo repository:

    flatpak-builder --repo=flatpak-repo com.uploadedlobster.peek \
      --gpg-sign=B539AD7A5763EE9C1C2E4DE24C14923F47BF1A02 \
      flatpak-stable.json --force-clean

You can build for different architecture with the `--arch` parameter, e.g.
`--arch=x86_64` or `--arch=i386`.

Generate a `.flatpak` file for single file distribution:

    flatpak build-bundle flatpak-repo peek-1.0.0-0.flatpak \
      com.uploadedlobster.peek stable
