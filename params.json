{"name":"Peek","tagline":"Simple animated Gif screen recorder","body":"### About\r\nA simple tool that allows you to record short animated GIF images from your screen.\r\n\r\nCurrently only Linux with X11 is supported. Other Unix like systems using X11\r\nshould work as well. It is planned to also support Wayland and maybe other\r\noperating systems in the future.\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n#### Runtime\r\n\r\n  * GTK+ >= 3.10\r\n  * GLib >= 2.38\r\n  * FFmpeg\r\n  * ImageMagick\r\n  * Window manager with compositing enabled\r\n\r\n#### Development\r\n\r\n * Vala compiler\r\n * CMake >= 2.6\r\n * Gettext\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n#### Arch Linux\r\nFor Arch Linux there is a\r\n[PKGBUILD](https://aur4.archlinux.org/packages/peek/) available in the AUR.\r\n\r\n#### Ubuntu / Debian\r\nA x86_64 DEB package is provided for download for the [latest release](https://github.com/phw/peek/releases).\r\n\r\nIn theory this package should also work on Debian. In practice you will miss the ffmpeg package. libav is currently not directly usable as a replacement, but I am working on it ;)\r\n\r\n#### From source\r\nYou can build and install Peek using CMake:\r\n\r\n    cmake . && make\r\n    make install\r\n\r\n### Translations\r\nYou can help translate Peek into your language.
