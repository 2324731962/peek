NAME
  peek - create animated GIF screencasts

SYNOPSIS
  peek [OPTION...]

DESCRIPTION
  Peek creates animated GIF screencasts using ffmpeg and imagemagick. It was
  built for the specific use case of recording screen areas, e.g., for easily
  showing UI features of your own apps or for showing a bug in bug reports. It is
  not a general purpose screencast app with extended features and it never
  will be.
