Description: Simple animated GIF screen recorder with an easy to use interface
 Peek creates animated GIF screencasts using FFmpeg and ImageMagick. It was
 built for the specific use case of recording screen areas, e.g., for easily
 showing UI features of your own apps or for showing a bug in bug reports. It is
 not a general purpose screencast app with extended features and it never
 will be.
 .
 It also requires a window manager with compositing enabled.
